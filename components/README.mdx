# Components

Pages, like templates and partials are components which are allowed to have access
to the application context.

All pages should have a folder with the same name as the page route and contain
at least an `index.tsx` and a `[pagename].stories.tsx` file.

Unless there are special requirements for a page which require custom documentation
you do not need to create a [pagename].mdx file for the page.

## Page Styling

Generally speaking, pages should not have any styling. If you need to style a page
you should create a new component or partial and style that instead. However, if
the styling is specific to the page and not reusable, then it is acceptable to
style the page directly. In this case, you should create a `[pagename].module.scss`
file and import it into the page as you would for any other component.
