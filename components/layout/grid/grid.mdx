## Setting the column count

You can specify the maximum number of columns with the `columns` prop.
The grid will automatically adjust the number of columns based on the available space.

By default, the grid will display 1 column at all screen sizes.

You can also specify the max number of columns to 3 or 2, which will display 3 columns full-width, 2 columns at $medium, and 1 column at anything smaller.

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.WithThreeColumns} />

Or you can have a max of 2 columns, which will display 2 columns full-width, and 1 column at anything smaller.

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.WithTwoColumns} />

<Tip>A 1 column grid is useful for spacing out content vertically.</Tip>

## Choosing the root node

By default, the grid will render a `<div>` element as the root node. However, it can be useful to render a `<ul>` or `<ol>` element instead.
You can do this by specifying the `as` prop.

<Tip type="danger">
  It is up to you to ensure that the children of the Grid are valid items for
  your chosen root node.
</Tip>

### Render as `<ul>`

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.RenderAsUl} />

### Render as `<ol>`

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.RenderAsOl} />
