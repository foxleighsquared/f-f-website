<Tip type="warning">
  The RichText component supports all the HTML tags, but it is recommended to
  use only the components provided by the library where possible. E.g. the
  `table` element is styled correcty as you can see below but it would be better
  to use the <a href="/docs/components-data-display-table--docs">Table</a>{' '}
  component instead. To discourage the use of the HTML tags some of them are
  unstyled.
</Tip>

<Tip type="warning">
  Only on H1 tag is allowed per page, so if you try to add a H1 tag to the
  RichText component you will get a very clear error message.
</Tip>

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.WithH1Tag} />

<Tip>
  If you are using the RichText component to display content from the Sanity
  CMS, you do not need to pass children, just pass the content from Sanity as a
  `richText` prop.
